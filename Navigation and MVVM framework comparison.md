Remark:
* voyager and preCompose seems abandoned!
* Appx solely focused on navigation => woth to take a look
* decompose and circuit stands out as both MVVM framework + navigation solution => let's focus on them first.

### decompose
* It add a abstraction layer, even own a reactivity system 
	* adding üëé complexity + üëé verbosity + üëé steeper learning curve but üëç offer clarity (no magic)
	* üëç Doesn't depend on anything (evens the Compose API) so the Decompose's API is stable, learn once works anywhere
	* üëç the most suitable for cross-platform development (thanks to this abstraction layer)
	* üëç the best testability (thanks to this abstraction layer)
* üëç work the same for any kind of UI (compose, android, desktop, iOS, web)
* üÜó Component is in fact the ViewModel
* üÜó BloC pattern from Flutter
 
## circuit	
* üÜó compose UI only => heavily android, desktop, iOS via sikya (not native), Web experimental
* üëéCircuit's Screen requires the Android's `@Parcelize`, and the `Parcelable` interface. Devs have 2 choices
	* First choice: Screen implementations per platform specific.
		* Note: the "screen" is just a data class used as key and to hold the screen parameters, it is mostly fine to copy / paste it to different platform => but still this choice require (a little of) codes-duplication.
	* Second choice: Setup a multi-platform `@Parcelize` alias via `gradle` build's hack so that the Screen implementation can stays in `commonMain` (checkout the "star" example)
* üëç The composable `Presenter` based on existing (and familiar) compose reactivity system. So üëé it can use `rememberSavable` which is Android's-specific-made-for-multi-platform
* üÜó Presenter is in fact the ViewModel (not the Presenter in Model-View-Presenter)
* üëç Support Codes Generation (`@CircuitInject`) to avoid verbosity

## "standard" navigation solution
* Android jetpack navigation [nav2](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/design#compose)
	* declarative navigation, we "design a navigation graph"  
	
* Android jetpack navigation [nav3](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/05/announcing-jetpack-navigation-3-for-compose.html)
	* Nav3 moves away from the rigid, XML-first **Navigation Graph** concept of Nav2 that you referenced, and instead focuses entirely on the **state of the back stack**.
	* Solving Adaptive Display with a Declarative Approach
		* The back stack remains the **single source of truth** for all screen sizes
		* Nav3 introduces the **Scenes API**, which is a flexible layout layer that looks at the current back stack state and the current **window size class** (e.g., compact, medium, expanded).
		* The Scene then **declares** the layout based on these two inputs:
			* - **Small Screen (Compact):** The Scene might only render the **topmost** item of the back stack, showing one screen at a time (single-pane phone UI).
			* **Large Screen (Expanded):** The Scene might render the **top two or three** items of the back stack simultaneously in a side-by-side layout, creating a list-detail or multi-pane view.
* [jetbrains's navigation-compose](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/compose-navigation.html#alternative-navigation-solutions) 
	* inspired from jetpack navigation for KMP, should be similar (to be confirmed)
